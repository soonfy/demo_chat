For example:\n// invoked for any requests passed to this router\nrouter.use(function(req, res, next) {\n  // .. some logic here .. like any other middleware\n  next();\n});\n\n// will handle any request that ends in /events\n// depends on where the router is \"use()'d\"\nrouter.get('/events', function(req, res, next) {\n  // ..\n});\n\nYou can then use a router for a particular root URL in this way separating your routes into files or even mini-apps.\n// only requests to /calendar/* will be sent to our \"router\"\napp.use('/calendar', router);",
